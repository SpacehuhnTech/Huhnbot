We recommend contacting the seller or manufacturer (i.e., DSTIKE) if you have hardware issues. But you can also try to reflash the firmware. We made a tutorial for the Deauther (https://blog.spacehuhn.com/install-deauther-using-arduino/) and the WiFi Duck (https://wifiduck.com/docs/category/software-installation). Hope that helps! :smiley:"
